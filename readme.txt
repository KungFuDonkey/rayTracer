Operation: 
- Arrows: move player
- WASD: rotate player
- E: go to next scene
- Q: go to previous scene 

Notes:
- 5th scene takes long to render, but the result is very nice
- Try to move around in the scene, they get much more interesting. 
- Some scenes have a lot of triangles, so moving is a bit slower
